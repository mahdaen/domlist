{"name":"DOMList","tagline":"DOMList simplify the native .querySelectorAll()","body":"DOMList\r\n=======\r\n**DOMList** simplify the native `.querySelectorAll()`. It's like a jQuery, but smaller since we use the native selector, also has more difference methods. But, it's only supported by browsers that support `.querySelectorAll()` API (Chrome 31+, Firefox 33+, IE9+, Safari 7+).\r\n\r\nEven though it's similar with jQuery, it's has many difference like what the `.attr()` do. While jQuery only get the attribute as string, **DOMList** try to convert the result as javascript object. E.g:\r\n```\r\n<span foo=\"bar: 1, foobar: 2\"></span>\r\n```\r\n**DOMList** will return an object `{ bar: 1, foobar: 2 }` when getting the `foo` attribute.\r\n\r\nMy target is to help the web application development. I try to keep looking the possible ways to simplify the native browser API, like when I try to simplify the usage of `Notifications` API only with `$.notification('Notification Test').show();`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to run **DOMList** on old browsers that don't support `.querySelectorAll()`, you can load Sizzle before loading **DOMList**. **DOMList** will looking for Sizzle when `.querySelectorAll()` is not available.\r\n\r\n**DOMList** also bundled with [NativeJS](https://github.com/mahdaen/native-js) that have usefull functions.\r\n\r\n#### **Downloads**\r\n**DOMList** is available on NPM and Bower. So you can get the **DOMList** via `npm` and `bower`.\r\n```\r\nnpm install domlist\r\n```\r\n```\r\nbower install domlist\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### **API Docs**\r\nRead the docs here: [API Docs](https://mahdaen.github.io/domlist/apidocs)\r\n\r\n#### **Contributions**\r\nFeel free to contribute to this project. The active development is located at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/keong/domlist). We use github only to publish the releases. Just create a merge request on gitlab and we will check that. ;)\r\n\r\nWe create the documentation using apiDoc and grunt. The documentation contains version comparison to makes user know the diffrence between each version. So, please write the documentation on the top of the module and add the version on that.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
